# Add all required folder and files to ensure site works

## Background

As a developer I would like to initialize my framework.dev specific framework
site so that the rest of the team and contributor can add content to make it
useful for the wider community.

## Acceptance

- [ ] Add all Data files
- [ ] Add all Script required for development and production release in
      package.json

## Notes:

- This ticket is NOT going to tackle the addition of the current site on
  amplify. This is going to be handled by another ticket.
