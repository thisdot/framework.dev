# Add Libraries content for framework

## Background

As a visitor of the framework specific Framework.dev site I would like to have
the ability to see enough Libraries content to keep me informed and find this
site to be resourceful and useful.

Libraries have to be split into

- State management

- Styling
- Component Library
- Form
- Framework
- Internationalization

      category.

- [ ] Test each individual look and external link

NOTE:

- This task is timeboxed to a maximum of 8 hours.
